# Preact Boilerplate Using webpack 2

Another preact boilerplate, but this time it works. The reason I created this is most of the boilerplates out there assume that some dependencies are installed globally like `babel-presets-*`.
Most of the stuff are taken from few projects I was working on and mostly from the [file-upload-example](https://github.com/contentful-labs/file-upload-example).
